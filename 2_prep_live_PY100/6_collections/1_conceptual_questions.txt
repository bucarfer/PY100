1. Are sequences collections? What about mappings?
Yes, sequences they are a type of collection, sequence is an ordered collection where its elements have a position/index
(list, tuples, str, ranges)
Yes, mappings are also a type of collection, mappings are an unordered collection of key_value pairs. the most common mapping is dictionary.

2. What is the difference between sequence, mapping, and sets?
-sequence is an ordered collection where elements have indexes
there are some specific functions like sorting or slice that are only available in ordered collections, also sequence can have repetitive elements. 
-mapping is an unordered collection with key-value pairs
-sets are an unordered collection of unique elements. 

3. What are our common immutable collection in Python?
tuples (forgot), sequence, an unordered immutable collection. 
frozenset , sets
strings, sequences 
range, sequences  

4. What happens when we try to access a value from a dictionary with a key that doesn't exist? How can we avoid this?
We get an KeyError, we can avoid this by using the function "get" or "in"

5. What happens when we try to access an index value in a list but it doesn't exist? How can we avoid this?
We get an indexError, we can avoid it by checking the length and making sure is the index is within.
