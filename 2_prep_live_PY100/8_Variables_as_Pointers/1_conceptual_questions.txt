Tips to start the core curriculum 

Prep are not mastery based

two-pass approach (multiple-pass)
first pass -> stress-free (if you need to check the solution is ok)
second pass -> lights on, everything makes sense (you should be able to resolve all the exercises, apart from the very challenging one)

# SPOT sessions, Brandi recommends to join the spot sessions 
as soon as we can. 

# TA-led study sessions (same as SPOT sessions)

# De-isolate (everyone is selfmotivated and wants study bodies)

At least meet once or twice a week to study in groups
Hanging up in slack and asking questions when you have to 

1. What does it mean to reassign a variable?
to give a variable a new value, pointing to a new location where the new value is stored

The old object (object A) will stay in the memory

2. Is it possible to have multiple variables pointing to the same object?
Yes, lots of variables can point to one object 

3. Can variables reference other variables?
No, we can point a variable to another variable value, but if we change the value of the reference valuable it will not update the value automatically of the other variable
a = 42
b = 32

a = b 
a = 32 

# a = 32 CORRECT 
# a = b = 32 NOT CORRECT 

b = 'foo'
print(a) = 32 

4. Can I create a list that contains variables?
In reality no, we can create a list with variables, but the variables are changed by its values as soon as we print the list, and we will not be able to use a variable if the variable doesn't point to a value 

c = 1
d = 2
e = 3

my list = [c, d, e]
print(my_list) = [1, 2, 3]

c = 'boo'

print(my_list) = [1, 2, 3]

5. Are there any other pointers that we have to consider when discussing variables as pointers?
LS. collections could be pointers, list indexes and dictionary keys act in a very similar way than pointers.
