#What are the main built-in data types in Python?
Strings, boolean, sets, tuples, lists, dictionaries, range, None, Binary types, numeric types (integers, floats, and complex)

#Do variables have types?
Yes and no, python is a bit ambiguous, in other programs once we assign a type to a variable we cannot change it, but python is more flexible 

#Can you perform operations between different data types?
Depending on what types.  

#What is type coercion? How can you perform coercion?
LS: converting one data type to another, using a function that makes the change (name constructors) f.g. str(1)

#What is the difference between explicit and implicit type coercion?
LS
Implicit is when python does it for us 2 + 2.5
Explicit is when we ask python to change the type with a constr. str(1)

#What is the difference between an expression and a statement?
LS
an expression is any type of code that produces a value 
3 + 5           # evaluates to 8
"hello".upper() # evaluates to 'HELLO'
x * 2           # produces a value based on x


a statement is an instruction that performs an action (it may contain an expression within that will produce a value, but not always)

x = 10              # assignment statement
print("Hello")      # function call statement
if x > 5:           # conditional statement
    print("big")
