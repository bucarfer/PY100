1. What is  variable in python, and why do we need them?
A variable in an object to which we assign a value, this value can be reassign as many times as needed.
A variable is used to store data. 

2. What is an expression? How is an expression different from a statement? What are some examples?

An expression is any piece of code that has a value as a result.
Another way of testing if we have an expression is if we can print it in the REPL>>> print()

3 + 4          # Expression (evaluates to 7)
len("hello")   # Expression (evaluates to 5)
x * y          # Expression (returns the product of x and y)


A statement is a complete line of code that does something.
It may contain one or more expressions, but it's focused on action, like assigning, defining, or controlling flow.
it doesn't have to return a value.

x = 3 + 4        # Assignment statement (contains an expression)
def greet():     # Function definition statement
    print("Hi")  # Print statement
if x > 5:        # Conditional statement (contains expression `x > 5`)

3. What is the difference between a local variable and a constant in Python?

A local variable is a variable within a function, that doesn't affect the global variables outside the function.

A constant in Python represents a value that we don't want to change in Python and we should not change it, and easy way of identifying them is that they are represented in capital letters. 

4. What is the difference between reassignment and mutation?
reassignment is when we assign a new value to a variable
mutation is when we change the value in place and it can be done only with mutable objects like lists, dictionaries, sets

contrary of non mutable objects: int, floats, complex, strings, tuples, frozen sets
